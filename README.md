# Kevin Phan's Email Template with Bootstrap

**Notes**
    - Please don't look at my code, because I fail in life.

**Issues**
    - CODE: theme-toggler on expanded screen size is not placed correctly either on the same navbar as email icon or centered.
    - CODE: At display width 768-781, the initial menu-nav does not appear
    - CODE: External elements like the collapsible menu, attach file icon, and send button is not compatible with the dark theme.
    - BUG: When dark theme is enabled, the margins and padding is changed for every element
